{"name":"Hackernews / Reddit / ProductHunt - open-source rails clone","tagline":"This is a starting point to get your own simple social link-sharing website. Its built with ruby-on-rails","body":"# Reddit-Hackernews-ProductHunt Clone on Rails\r\n\r\n**[DEMO](https://hackernews-rails-clone.herokuapp.com/)**\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://cdn.rawgit.com/blairanderson/rails-hackernews-reddit-producthunt-clone/master/public/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\nThis is the `readme.md` for a Ruby on Rails application that mimics social news link sharing websites like HackerNews, ProductHunt, and Reddit.\r\n\r\nObviously the styling is different but the base functionality exists.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nBecause when i was learning to program, I wanted to play with code that had a familiar model and get some instant gratification.\r\n\r\nThe problem with learning to code is the learning-curve. Shit is real and painful and i found that the best cure for the pain was cloning an app with features and tweaking until it broke and learning along the way.\r\n\r\nI think this is why wordpress is SO popular. Its stupid-easy to fire-up, and changes come with one-click package installs and tiny code changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n- A visitor can view the list of items\r\n- A visitor can view a single item and comment on it\r\n- A visitor can register for an account\r\n- A user can login and logout\r\n- A user can submit a new item\r\n- A user can like/unlike an item\r\n\r\n\r\n### Deploy?\r\n\r\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)\r\n\r\n### Change the Code!!!\r\n\r\nMy main goal for this is to give new programmers some code to look at and talk about. Anytime i [get questions](/issues), I plan to add them here...\r\n\r\n*Open your terminal*\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:blairanderson/rails-hackernews-reddit-producthunt-clone.git link-site\r\n$ cd link-site\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Lets look at some code*\r\n\r\nWhen someone visits your website, they're literally just *request*ing some HTML, CSS, and Javascript! *requests* come to your application through the ROUTER.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n # config/routes.rb\r\n\r\nRails.application.routes.draw do\r\n  resources :items, except: [:destroy] do\r\n    resources :item_comments\r\n    member do\r\n      post :toggle\r\n      post :vote, to: 'user_item_votes#create'\r\n      delete :vote, to: 'user_item_votes#destroy'\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  root to: 'items#index'\r\n\r\n  resources :users, except: [:index]\r\n  resources :user_sessions, only: [:new, :create, :destroy]\r\n\r\n  get 'login' => 'user_sessions#new', as: :login\r\n  match 'logout' => 'user_sessions#destroy', as: :logout, via: [:get, :post]\r\n\r\n  namespace :admin do\r\n    root to: 'items#index'\r\n    resources :items\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-61052500-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
